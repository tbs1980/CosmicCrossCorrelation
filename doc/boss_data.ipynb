     "source": "# BOSS Healpix map creation\n\nThis page describes the steps to create BOSS Healpix maps to be used in the zphot x zspec cross-correlation analysis. Part A describes the different BOSS products employed, while part B describes the creation of Healpix maps and masks from these products. For the moment, we will be working with DR10 data. The catalogs, weights and masks used can be found at the [BOSS LSS DR10 data page](http://data.sdss3.org/sas/dr10/boss/lss/).\n\n# A) BOSS DR10 data\n\nThis section closely follows a [BOSS tutorial](https://www.sdss3.org/dr10/tutorials/lss_galaxy.php) describing how to create LSS catalogs from raw data and masks. The focus is on stripping information down so we decide which products we need in order to create our maps. The steps the tutorial describes are:\n\n   1. Create a target photometric catalog \n   2. Classify and match objects with redshift\n   3. Build the angular selection mask with accept and reject masks and filter the catalog\n   4. Downsample the SDSS legacy sample to BOSS completeness, remove incomplete sectors\n   5. Apply weights to individual objects\n   6. Define the radial selection function\n\nWe will not follow these steps exactly, but we will have to understand how to adapt some of them.\n\n## A.0) Terminology\n\n_It would be useful to add a small section here describing sectors, polygons, etc, etc_\n\n## A.1) Catalogs\n\n**11/Aug/2014: These catalogs, when cut in the redshift limits ($0.43 < z < 0.7$), contain the $N_{\\rm used}$ galaxies**\n\nThere are several catalogs available at the [DR10 data page](http://data.sdss3.org/sas/dr10/boss/lss/) mentioned above, and there is a bit of confusion as to what is the official version to use. From what I understand, the following are catalogs of spectroscopic data from the CMASS and LOWZ samples of the DR10 release **with accept and reject masks already applied**:\n\n   * galaxy_DR10v8_CMASS_North.fits.gz\n   * galaxy_DR10v8_CMASS_South.fits.gz\n   * galaxy_DR10v8_LOWZ_North.fits.gz\n   * galaxy_DR10v8_LOWZ_South.fits.gz\n\nIf these are used, steps 1-3 of the list above need not be performed. I'm not clear about step 4, i.e. whether these catalogs also include the SDSS legacy sample downsampled to BOSS completeness, but I suppose yes.\n\nWe still need the masks to create a mask/completeness Healpix map.\n\n## A.2) Masks\n\nThe angular selection function of the BOSS survey is defined by a set of masks. These masks are either _accept_ or _reject_ masks. Accept and reject masks are MANGLE polygon files with accept/reject pixels.\n\n## A.2.1) BOSS survey geometry and accept masks\n\nThe survey geometry is described by the file boss_geometry_2012_11_19.fits, while accept masks are divided in CMASS/LOWZ and North/South regions:\n\n   * mask_DR10v8_CMASS_North.ply\n   * mask_DR10v8_CMASS_South.ply\n   * mask_DR10v8_LOWZ_North.ply\n   * mask_DR10v8_LOWZ_South.ply\n\nDocumentation for both these files is [here](http://data.sdss3.org/datamodel/files/BOSS_LSS_REDUX/mask/MASK.html). The BOSS geometry file seems to give the full expected footprint of the survey, so I'm not sure it's useful. The masks, on the other hand have a weight column that gives each sector completeness, as described in [Anderson et al. (2012)](http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/427/4/3435).\n\n## A.2.2) Sector completeness\n\nEach polygon belongs to a sector, and each with an unique completeness value. The completeness is given by:\n\n$$C_{\\rm BOSS} = \\frac{N_{\\rm obs} + N_{\\rm cp}}{N_{\\rm targ} - N_{\\rm known}}\\,,$$\n\n$$N_{\\rm targ} = N_{\\rm star}+N_{\\rm gal}+N_{\\rm fail}+N_{\\rm cp}+N_{\\rm missed}+N_{\\rm known}\\,,$$\n\n$$N_{\\rm obs} = N_{\\rm star}+N_{\\rm gal}+N_{\\rm fail}\\,,$$\n\nand\n\n1. $N_{\\rm gal}$: galaxies with redshifts from good BOSS spectra.\n2. $N_{\\rm known}$: galaxies with redshifts from SDSS-II spectra.\n3. $N_{\\rm star}$: spectroscopically confirmed stars.\n4. $N_{\\rm fail}$: objects with BOSS spectra from which stellar classification or redshift determination failed.\n5. $N_{\\rm cp}$: objects with no spectra in a close pair.\n6. $N_{\\rm targ}$: objects with no spectra, **not** in a close pair, but removed when subsampling SDSS-II legacy galaxies.\n7. $N_{\\rm cp}$: almost the same as the close pair case, except that these are not observed because of a higher priority target nearby (e.g. quasar) and not a nearby object of the _same_ type, in each case it qualifies as $N_{\\rm cp}$.\n\nAdditionally, they define a redshift completeness, which is \n\n$$C_{\\rm red} = \\frac{N_{\\rm gal}}{N_{\\rm gal} + N_{\\rm fail}}\\,.$$\n\nIn the end, they apply two cuts:\n\n$$C_{\\rm BOSS} > 0.7\\,,$$\n$$C_{\\rm red} < 0.8 \\;\\&\\; N_{\\rm gal} > 10\\,.$$\n\nI don't know if the completeness given in the WEIGHT column of the mask_DR10v8\\*.ply files refers only to $C_{\\rm BOSS}$ or to $C_{\\rm red}$ too.\n\n## A.2.2) Reject masks\n\nFrom sect. 2.3 of [Anderson et al. (2013)](http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/441/1/24):\n\n\"In addition to tracking the outline of the survey region and the position of the spectroscopic plates, we apply several \u2018vetos\u2019 in constructing the catalogue. Regions were masked where the imaging was unphotometric, the PSF modelling failed, the imaging reduction pipeline timed out (usually due to too many blended objects in a single field), or the image was identified as having critical problems in any of the five photometric bands. We mask the small regions around the centre posts of the plates, where fibres cannot be placed due to physical limitations and also around bright stars in the Tycho catalogue (H\u00f8g et al. 2000), with area given by equation 9 of Anderson et al. (2012). We also place a mask at the locations of objects with higher priority (mostly high-z quasars) than galaxies, as a galaxy cannot be observed at a location within the fibre collision radius of these points. In total we masked \u223c5% of the area covered by the set of observed tiles due to our \u2018veto\u2019 mask.\"\n\nA list of the files needed is at the [BOSS tutorial](https://www.sdss3.org/dr10/tutorials/lss_galaxy.php) mentioned above. The files themselves are [here](http://data.sdss3.org/sas/dr10/boss/lss/reject_mask/) and their description is [here](http://data.sdss3.org/datamodel/files/BOSS_LSS_REDUX/reject_mask/MASK.html). **There are some inconsistencies between what is recommended in the tutorial, what is available online and what Marc used. An important to-do for tomorrow is to converge on the set of files that will be used.**\n\nThe masks are not needed for generating the galaxy catalogs, since there are masked catalogs already available, but they are needed for generating a healpix mask map. **Another to-do is to translate the information in these masks from SDSS polygons and sectors to healpix pixels in a coherent manner.**\n\n## A.3) Weights\n\nThe series of weights that must be applied to each galaxy when calculating clustering statistics are given as columns in the galaxy catalogs. Their description and instructions on how to apply them can be found in either the [BOSS tutorial](https://www.sdss3.org/dr10/tutorials/lss_galaxy.php) or in some of the BOSS papers. **An important point is that these weights are not necessarily the same from data release to data release.** Comparing eq. (18) of the DR9 [Anderson et al. (2012)](http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/427/4/3435) with eq. (18) (again!) of the DR10+11 [Anderson et al. (2013)](http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/441/1/24):\n\n$w_{\\rm tot} = w_{\\rm FKP} w_{\\rm sys} (w_{\\rm rf} + w_{\\rm cp} -1)\\,$ [DR9]\n\n$w_{\\rm tot} = w_{\\rm see} w_{\\rm sys} (w_{\\rm rf} + w_{\\rm cp} -1)\\,$ [DR10+11]\n\nwe see that there is a _seeing_ correction $w_{\\rm see}$ not present in DR9 (because it was verified to be irrelevant) and an FKP weighting not present in DR10+11 (**I don't know why...**). I summarize the meaning of each of these weights, with sections in the [Anderson et al. (2012)](http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/427/4/3435) paper indicated for further details:\n\n   * $w_{\\rm rf}$: Not all spectra taken provide good redshift measurements (98.2% success rate). Upweights nearest neighbour galaxy by +1 for each failure. (_sect. 3.4_)\n   * $w_{\\rm cp}$: Objects closer than fiber diameter cannot be simultaneously observed (~5% of selected targets). For each observed target, equals one + the number of unobserved targets within 62\". (_sect. 3.2_)\n   * $w_{\\rm sys}$: To compensate for density fluctuations, mostly induced by star density variations. Other sources of systematic density fluctuations include galactic extinction, seeing (**not for DR10+11, see below**), air mass and sky background, but it was seen that a star density + fiber magnitude correction is sufficient (_sect. 3.6_). The equation is:\n   \n    $$w_{\\rm sys}(n_{\\rm s}, i_{\\rm fib2}) = A_{\\rm fib2} + B_{\\rm fib2}\\,n_{\\rm s}\\,,$$\n    \n    where $i_{\\rm fib2}$ is the magnitude in a 2\" aperture and $n_{\\rm s}$ is the local stellar density.\n    \n    \n   * $w_{\\rm FKP}$: \"(...) to optimize our clustering measurements in the face of shot-noise and cosmic variance, $w_{\\rm FKP}=(1+\\bar{n}(z_i)P_0)^{-1}$ \" (_FKP paper and sect 3.7_)\n   \n   * $w_{\\rm see}$: To compensate for density fluctuations induced by seeing variations (_sect. 2.4_ of [Anderson et al. (2013)](http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/441/1/24)). The equation is:\n   \n    $$w_{\\rm see} = A_{\\rm see} \\left [1 + {\\rm erf} \\left (\\frac{S - B_{\\rm see}}{\\sigma_{\\rm see}}\\right )\\right ]^{-1}\\,,$$\n    \n    where $S$ is the seeing value. The numerical values of parameters $A_{\\rm fib2}$, $B_{\\rm fib2}$, $A_{\\rm see}$, $B_{\\rm see}$ and $\\sigma_{\\rm see}$ can be found on page 7 of [Anderson et al. (2013)](http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/441/1/24)\n\nFor a discussion on how to calculate the Poisson shot noise for weighted galaxies, see Appendix A of [Gil-Mar\u00edn et al. (2014b)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.5668).\n\n\n# B) Creating Healpix maps\n\n**To-do list:**\n   * Decide which will be the input catalog\n   * Decide which weights we want to apply\n   * Decide which masks will be used, in which combination, and which are the files corresponding to them"
