# Writing documentation with Markdown format

We will write most of the documentation for the project in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax )  language. The syntax is very easy and there are plenty of help available in the web. 	

## Where can I find tutorials?

This document itself is written in Markdown syntax. Note that the file extension is `.md`. Below are some links where you can find some useful tutorials.
