# Attending: Bruno, Donnacha, Fil, Sree, Steph

**Next meeting: Friday, August 22st, 2pm, OB37**

## General logic
* We can already calculate BOSS cross-correlations between z bins, even if masks are not final.
* Do it at N=256 --> l~400 where non-linearities start getting important
* There will be problems of large-scale to small-scale coupling from bright star (small angular) masks
* To control for the mask effect, calculate full sample PS from low to high resolution, until results converge
* There won't be enough objects to populate a lot of pixels at high-resolution, which underestimates the power at small scales. There's a method to correct for this.

## To-dos with BOSS data

* Redshift cross-correlations, for N=256, create dz=0.05 shells. **(Bruno)**
* Calculate all the cross-spectra **(Sree)**
* Generate maps from N=128-->16384 **(Bruno)**
* Masks
   * See if we can get Mangle to work **(Sree + Bruno + Aurélien)**
   * Converge on the weights and masks **(Bruno + Marc)**

## To-dos with DES data

* Get Y1P1 data - Trivial Access **(Steph + Donnacha + Aurélien)**
* Get rid of false detections: MAG\_APER - MAG\_AUTO method **(Steph)**
* Photo-zs to calculate P(z) **(Steph to ask Iftach (+ DES-DM?))** 
* We also want DES maps from N = 128-->16384 **(Donnacha)**
* Review Star-galaxy separation **(Donnacha + Maayanne)**
* Decide cuts - we can discuss at the next meeting **(All)**

## Other to-dos

* Get Laura's PCL code **(Sree)**
* Apply correction for high-resolution maps **(Sree + ??)**
